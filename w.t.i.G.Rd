\title{
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
Compute the Inverse of Probability of Censoring Weighting
}
\description{
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
This function computes the Inverse of Probability of Censoring Weighting for a subject at some time point.
}
\usage{
w.t.i.G(t, i, time, delta, G)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{t}{
the specified time point in the Inverse of Probability of Censoring Weighting
}
  \item{i}{
the index of subject
}
  \item{time}{
the follow-up time in increasing order
}
  \item{delta}{
status indicators in increasing order of follow-up time
}
  \item{G}{
a matrix which each column denotes the estimated survival function of a subject for censoring time.
}
}

\details{
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
The survival function of censoring time can be estimated by different methods and the Kaplan-Meier estimator is used in our model averaging approach.

%%  ~Describe the value returned

\note{
%%  ~~further notes~~
The dimension of "time" need be the same as the order of square matrix "G". The status indicator is 1 for the dead and 0 for the alive. It should be noted that the survival functions in "G" correspond to censoring time rather than survival time.
